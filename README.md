# 4coder_fleury_odin

### Integration

Drop files in 4coder_fluery custom layer and make sure to run **build_lexers.bat** to build the odin lexer. For the syntax highlighting to work
properly make sure to add missing fields from **theme-fleury.4coder** to your theme.

### Current state

Since the layer doesn't handle packages at all GoTo definition and function helper only works 
with distinct names of functions/types,and as a result syntax highlighting will be buggy. 
But if you are using 4coder_fleury custom layer it can still benefit you a lot.
